# VOWLExplain
We present VOWLExplain, an extension of WebVOWL framework for explainable AI. The main goal of this project is to help in the visualization of explanations for artificial intelligence, specially in the field of personalized medicine, by providing an interactive visualization that allows the user to explore and validate it.

# Data

The JSON files in the data folder contain some examples of expalantions for six different cases plus an example.

# Source Code

The source folder contains the source code of VOWLExplain.

# Running VOWLExplain

To run VOWLExplain on your machine, download and unpack ZIP folder. After that, in the extracted VOWLExplain folder, open the HTML file to execute VOWLExplain.

Note that the conversion of ontologies into the VOWL-JSON format is not part of VOWLExplain but requires an additional converter such as OWL2VOWL, or Matcha.
